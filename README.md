## My approach to the assignment

Before I started writing the code, I created simple mockups to make it easier to create the UI.
It was tricky for me to design the table for small devices. I had a hard time deciding whether to allow horizontal scrolling for the table or to let the text wrap in columns. From a user's perspective, it seems to me that this table would be used more for copying some data, so I decided to display the wrapped text in columns.

Coding was very enjoyable for me. I often use these technologies, so I didn't have any major issues with the implementation. I've read the best practices and style guide for Redux to improve readability and project structure. I also used components from shadcn/ui, which made creating the UI much easier.
